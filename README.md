# Weather Forecast

## Description
Server-side APIs (Application Programming Interface) are applications used by developers to increase development speed helping integrating new software to existing apps facilitating the user a better experience in a shorter amount of time.

OpenWeather is one of many open source APIs who facilitate information to develop web applications. In this case we were asked to create a weather-forecast application.
